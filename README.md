This project illustrates how to encode and encode JWT tokens using two alternatives to Microsoft WIF library. The first method uses the https://github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose-jwt and the associated nuget package is available here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/jose-jwt/

The second method uses code I adapted from ths StackOver flow item: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10106800/1910061
